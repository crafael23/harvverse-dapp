## Technical Deep Dive

Harvverse is built as a yarn monorepo, separating the on-chain and off-chain logic into distinct packages for clarity and scalability.

### Project Structure

-   **`packages/hardhat`**: This package contains the heart of our on-chain logic.
    -   `contracts/`: Home to the Solidity smart contracts, including `CropNFT.sol` and the core `InvestmentAgreement.sol`.
    -   `deploy/`: Contains the deployment scripts that push our contracts to the blockchain. The scripts are ordered to ensure dependencies are handled correctly (`01_deploy_crop_nft.ts`, `03_deploy_investment_agreement.ts`).
    -   `test/`: Unit and integration tests for the smart contracts, ensuring their reliability and security.

-   **`packages/nextjs`**: The frontend application that brings Harvverse to life for users.
    -   `app/`: Built with the Next.js App Router, this directory defines the routes and user-facing pages of the platform.
    -   `components/`: Contains reusable React components, including standard UI elements from Scaffold-ETH 2 and custom components tailored for Harvverse's functionality.
    -   `hooks/`: Leverages Scaffold-ETH 2's powerful custom hooks (`useScaffoldReadContract`, `useScaffoldWriteContract`) to simplify interaction with our smart contracts, providing type-safe and reactive data fetching.
    -   `contracts/`: Holds the ABI and deployment information for our smart contracts, automatically generated by the `yarn deploy` command to keep the frontend in sync with the backend.

### Smart Contract Architecture

The core logic of Harvverse is implemented in two main Solidity smart contracts:

-   **`CropNFT.sol`**: An `ERC721` token contract that represents unique crop lots. Each NFT is minted by a farmer and contains an immutable metadata URI pointing to details about the crop (e.g., type, expected yield, location). This token serves as the digital representation of the real-world agricultural asset and acts as collateral within the investment agreements.

-   **`InvestmentAgreement.sol`**: This is the central contract managing the entire investment lifecycle.
    -   **State Management**: It uses enums (`AgreementStatus`, `FulfilmentOption`) to track the state of each agreement, from `Proposed` to `Funded`, `ProduceReady`, and finally `Settled` or `Defaulted`.
    -   **Deal Proposal**: Farmers initiate agreements by calling `proposeAgreement`, which escrows their `CropNFT` in the contract and records the deal's financial terms.
    -   **Funding & Option Selection**: Investors call `fundAgreement` with the required ETH amount. Crucially, at this moment, they must choose their fulfilment option:
        1.  `DELIVER_PRODUCE`: The investor will receive the physical harvest.
        2.  `SHARE_PROFITS`: The investor allows the farmer to sell the produce and receives a pre-agreed percentage of the profits.
    -   **Automated Settlement**: The contract includes functions (`confirmDelivery`, `reportSale`) that handle the final settlement. An external oracle (or for this MVP, the contract owner) confirms physical delivery, while the `reportSale` function automatically calculates and distributes the profit share, ensuring a trustless and transparent process.
    -   **Default Handling**: If deadlines are missed, the `claimCollateral` function allows the investor to claim the escrowed `CropNFT`, protecting their investment.

### Deployed Contracts

Harvverse smart contracts are deployed on multiple networks:

- **InvestmentAgreement**: [`0xCB78156636E5A2B9d17f897976CCBd1324c4d53b`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xCB78156636E5A2B9d17f897976CCBd1324c4d53b)

### Contract Interaction Flow

The two main contracts, `CropNFT` and `InvestmentAgreement`, work in tandem to create a transparent and automated investment process.

1.  **Minting the Asset**: A farmer initiates the process by minting a `CropNFT` via the `mint(tokenURI)` function. This creates a unique on-chain asset representing their crop.

2.  **Proposing the Deal**:
    -   **Approval**: Before proposing a deal, the farmer must first call `approve()` on the `CropNFT` contract, granting the `InvestmentAgreement` contract permission to manage their specific NFT (the one they wish to use as collateral).
    -   **Proposal**: The farmer then calls `proposeAgreement(...)` on the `InvestmentAgreement` contract. This function performs several key actions:
        -   It validates the deal parameters (e.g., investment amount > 0, deadlines are in the future).
        -   It securely pulls the approved `CropNFT` from the farmer's wallet into the contract's escrow using `safeTransferFrom`.
        -   It creates a new `Agreement` struct, populates it with the deal terms, and sets its initial status to `Proposed`.

3.  **Funding the Deal**:
    -   An investor calls `fundAgreement(agreementId, option)` on the `InvestmentAgreement` contract, sending the required ETH.
    -   The contract validates that the correct amount of ETH has been sent and that the agreement is still in the `Proposed` state.
    -   It records the investor's address and their chosen fulfilment option (`DELIVER_PRODUCE` or `SHARE_PROFITS`).
    -   The investment amount is **immediately and atomically** transferred to the farmer's address.
    -   The agreement status is updated to `Funded`.

4.  **Executing and Settling the Agreement**:
    -   **Harvest**: The farmer calls `markHarvestReady(agreementId)` to signal that the crop is ready, transitioning the agreement to the `ProduceReady` state.
    -   **Settlement**:
        -   If `DELIVER_PRODUCE` was chosen, `confirmDelivery(agreementId)` is called (by a trusted oracle in a full implementation) after physical delivery. This settles the agreement and returns the `CropNFT` to the farmer.
        -   If `SHARE_PROFITS` was chosen, the farmer calls `reportSale(agreementId, saleAmount)`, sending the investor's share of the proceeds. The contract verifies the amount, transfers the share to the investor, returns any excess funds to the farmer, and finally returns the `CropNFT`.
    -   **Default**: If the farmer fails to meet a deadline, the investor can call `claimCollateral(agreementId)`. The contract verifies the deadline has passed and transfers the escrowed `CropNFT` to the investor as compensation.

Throughout this process, the contracts emit events (`AgreementProposed`, `AgreementFunded`, etc.) to provide a transparent, on-chain record of every state change, which the frontend uses to update the UI in real-time.

### Frontend Application Flow

The Next.js application provides two distinct user journeys for Farmers and Investors, facilitated by a suite of purpose-built pages:

**For Farmers 🌾:**

1.  **Mint CropNFT (`/mint`)**: The journey begins here. A farmer provides a metadata URI (e.g., an IPFS link) for their crop lot, which includes details like crop type, expected yield, and quality. The platform then calls the `mint` function on the `CropNFT` contract, creating a unique token representing their agricultural asset.
2.  **Create Deal (`/create-deal`)**: With a `CropNFT` in their wallet, the farmer can propose an investment deal. This page fetches the farmer's owned NFTs and allows them to select one as collateral. They then fill out a form with the investment terms:
    -   **Investment Amount**: The capital required, in ETH.
    -   **Investor Profit Share**: The percentage of sale proceeds for the investor if they choose the profit-sharing option.
    -   **Expected Yield**: The quantity of the crop (e.g., in kg).
    -   **Deadlines**: Timelines for the harvest and subsequent delivery or sale.
    Submitting this form first triggers an `approve` transaction on the `CropNFT` contract, followed by a call to `proposeAgreement` on the `InvestmentAgreement` contract, which locks the NFT and lists the deal.

**For Investors 💼:**

1.  **Browse Deals (`/invest`)**: Investors explore a marketplace of open investment opportunities. The page reads the total number of agreements from the `InvestmentAgreement` contract and dynamically renders a card for each `Proposed` deal, fetching and displaying its specific terms.
2.  **Fund & Choose Option**: On each deal card, an investor can select their preferred fulfillment option:
    -   `📦 Receive Physical Produce`: For businesses or individuals who want the crops themselves.
    -   `💰 Share Profits`: For those seeking a financial return.
    After selecting an option and clicking "Fund," the application calls the `fundAgreement` function, sending the required ETH and locking their choice on-chain.

**Dashboard & Tracking (`/dashboard`)**

This is the central hub for all users to manage and monitor their activities:

-   **Role-Based Views**: The dashboard intelligently detects if the user is a Farmer, Investor, or both, and customizes the interface accordingly.
-   **Asset & Agreement Tracking**: It fetches and displays all `CropNFTs` owned by the user and all `InvestmentAgreements` they are a party to (either as a farmer or investor).
-   **Lifecycle Actions**: Based on an agreement's status, specific actions become available:
    -   A farmer can **Mark Harvest Ready**.
    -   If the profit-share option was chosen, the farmer can **Report Sale** and distribute proceeds.
    -   An investor can **Confirm Delivery** for the produce option.
    -   In case of a default, an investor can **Claim Collateral**.
-   **Status & Deadlines**: Each agreement's status (e.g., `Funded`, `ProduceReady`, `Settled`) and deadlines are clearly displayed, providing a transparent overview of the entire process.

**Developer & Diagnostic Tools:**

-   **`/debug`**: A powerful interface for developers to directly interact with all functions (read and write) of the deployed smart contracts.
-   **`/blockexplorer`**: A local block explorer that provides detailed views of transactions, addresses, contract code, and storage, aiding in development and debugging.
